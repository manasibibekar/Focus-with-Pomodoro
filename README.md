# Focus-with-Pomodoro

The Graphical User Interface (GUI) application features a timer that allows users to manage their work and break times efficiently. The timer is set for 25 minutes of work time, followed by a 5-minute break time. This cycle is repeated four times to provide a total of four sets for work and break times.

The application assists users in managing their time more effectively by encouraging them to take regular breaks and avoid overworking themselves. By following this timed work and break cycle, users can increase their productivity and reduce the risk of burnout.
